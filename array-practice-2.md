Complete the following exercises to improve your understanding of javascript functions!

Tests for each of these have been written and can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/davified/array-practice-2). Fork and git clone it to make use of the tests! Detailed instructions in the test repo.

1. Write a JavaScript function to remove a specific element from an array.

  * Sample input: removeArrayElement([2, 5, 9, 6], 5))
  * Sample output: [2, 9, 6]

2. Write a JavaScript function to get nth largest element from an unsorted array.

  * Sample input: nthlargest([ 43, 56, 23, 89, 88, 90, 99, 652], 4)
  * Sample output: 89

3. Write a JavaScript function to get a random item from an array.
  * Sample input: randomItem(['hello', 'hi', 'bye'])
  * Sample output: 'hello' // or 'hi', or 'bye'!

4. Write a JavaScript function to generate an array of specified length, filled with integer numbers, increase by a specific step from starting position.

  * Sample input: arrayRange(1, 4, 1))
  * Sample output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

  * Sample input: arrayRange(-6, 5, 2)
  * Sample output: [-6, -4, -2, 0, 2]
