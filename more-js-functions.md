# More JS functions

Complete the following exercises to improve your understanding of javascript functions!

1. Write a JavaScript function reverse(num) that takes a number and returns the reversed version of it.
  * Sample input: 32243;
  * Expected output: 34223

2. Write a JavaScript function isPalindrome(str) that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not? It should return true if str is a palindrome, and false if otherwise.
(A palindrome is word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., 'madam' or 'nurses run'.)

3. Write a JavaScript function alphabeticalSort(str) that returns a string with letters sorted in alphabetical order.
  * Sample input: 'webmaster'
  * Expected output: 'abeemrstw'

  (Assume punctuation and numbers symbols are not included in the passed string.)

4. Write a JavaScript function capitalizeSentence(str) that accepts a string as a parameter and converts the first letter of each word of the string in upper case.
  * Sample input: 'the quick brown fox'
  * Expected output: 'The Quick Brown Fox '

5. Write a JavaScript function countVowels(str) that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels within the string.
Note : As the letter 'y' can be regarded as both a vowel and a consonant, we do not count 'y' as vowel here.
  * Sample input: 'The quick brown fox'
  * Expected output: 5

6. Write a JavaScript function returnChange(amount, denominationArray) to convert an amount to coins.
  * Sample input: returnChange(46, [25, 10, 5, 2, 1]) (46 is the amount. and 25, 10, 5, 2, 1 are coins)
  * Expected output: [25, 10, 10, 1].

7. Write a JavaScript function letterCount(str) to get the number of occurrences of each letter in specified string. It should return an object with key value-pairs that denote the alphabets in the string (key) and the number of occurrences (value).
  * Sample input: letterCount('aabbc')
  * Expected output: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 1}

8. Write a JavaScript function specificLetterCount(str, character) that accepts two arguments, a string and a letter and the function will return the number of occurrences of the specified letter within the string.
  * Sample input : specificLetterCount('w3resource.com', 'o')
  * Expected output: 2
