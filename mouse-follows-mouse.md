# Mouse Follows Mouse
Google and find a picture of a mouse. Create a webpage using, HTML and javascript/jQuery, where the position of the mouse-picture matches the poisition of the mouse pointer.

### Bonus
Two possible extensions for you.
1. Rather than snap into place, have mouse-picture move over time towards the location of the the mouse-pointer.
2. Rotate the mouse-picture so it faces the mouse pointer it is moving towards.
