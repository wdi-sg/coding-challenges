# Random Quote Generator
Build a random quote generator that randomly displays a quote on the page. 

Use a variable of any data type you like to store 5-10 quotes. When user clicks a button, use DOM manipulation to randomly cycle through the quotes to display one on the page. 

Feel free to do this in vanilla JavaScript or jQuery, whichever you feel you need to practice. 

### Bonus
Add a 'click to Tweet' button that takes the current quote and opens it in a separate tab, letting the user tweet the quote (if user is logged in to Twitter).
